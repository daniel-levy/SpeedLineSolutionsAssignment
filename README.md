Below are the answers for the provided questions 

## Step 1.
This proposed "mushup" sounds very feasible. There are only a few key functionalities that need to be included into this final project. First, I would need to be able to display a map of British Columbia in a web based application. Next, I will need to be able to overlay markers that indicate where the cities of interest are on the map. Lastly, I will need to be able to retrieve weather information and then overlay it on the map as well. For this proof of concept, the front end of the application is simple HTML and CSS, and the more advanced functionality is implemented using Node.js. There are two third party APIs that are called by this web application. The first is the JavaScript Google Maps API, which can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial), that is used to retrieve the map which will be displayed to the users. The second is the OpenWeather API, which can be found [here](https://openweathermap.org/), that is used for retrieving the real time weather conditions. To deploy this web application, I have it running on a small EC2 instance. These tools and technologies are very prevalent in production web applications, but the main limitation would be the deployment platform. The EC2 instance that this service is deployed on is a free tier instance, and it would probably require something that could handle a greater load. In order to evaluate the key functionality described above, the foremost method I could use is manual testing. I can run the web application and ensure that the map loads correctly with the correct markers and displays the information when I interact with the markers. An additional method to test the last key functionality would be to write unit tests that would be able to test if I am able to retrieve data from the OpenWeather API correctly. I believe that I would be able to completely finish this proof of concept in the allotted time

## Step 2.
The source code for the completed proof of concept can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/daniel-levy/SpeedLineSolutionsAssignment) and the web application itself can be found [here](http://ec2-18-222-173-54.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/)
